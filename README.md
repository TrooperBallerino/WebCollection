## Web Collection

This is my first website, so while I was doing it I learnt:
- HTML
- CSS
- Basics of Javascript
- Access JSON files with JS

It was a scholastic project and my first HTML project, so I used only ion-icon as framework.

JSON format for records:
  {
    "Name": "Album Name",
    "Artist": "Artist Name",
    "Genre": "Music Genre",
    "MacroFormat": "Vinyl\Cassette\Compact Disc",
    "Format": "Type of Macroformat (ex. LP 12\" 33+1‚ÅÑ3 rpm)",
    "Label": "Napalm Records",
    "Description": 
    "Short description"
  }

  Style and Code structure took from "Responsive Business Agency Website Using Html CSS JavaScript" Youtube Video by codewithsadee
